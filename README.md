Repository created for iNeubytes Data Science project submission which consistes of :

Task 1: Analysis and processing of data, and with it's help predicting if the patient is diabetic(1) or not(0). Task 1 incorporates the various classifcation methods to predict
        whether the patient suffers from diabeties or not. The methods to classify includes :
		    1. Decision Tree Classifier
	        2. Random Forest Classifier
		    3. Naive Bayes Classifier
	        4. K Nearest Neighbour Classifier
		 And I also deployed confusion matrix as a part of evaluation methods to check :
            1. Accuracy
			2. Recall
            3. Precision
			4. F1 Score 



Task 2: Data exploration and preprocessing of dataset of bitcoin transaction, later performing feauture selection on the given data, visualization and making a predictive 
        regression model to predict the future transactions i.e. here closingvalue of bitcoins ('close') by applying linear regressor and random forest regressor on the 
        dataset. 
	The evaluation metrics was also drafted by using the evaluation parameter such as:
	1. Mean Absolute Error
        2. Mean Squared Error
	3. R-square .
        The required dataset is attached as https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/bitcoin-historical-data-2021



 Major Project: In this projecr we performed data preprocessing of the given online retail dataset, that is based on the transactional records of the UK based online e- 
                commerce company. I later on performed data cleaning, feature selection and feature generation, and I also made the predictive model based on the data and 
                then later used Tableau for data analysis and visualization purpose.
		The evaluation metrics was also drafted by using the evaluation parameter such as:
	        1. Mean Absolute Error
                2. Mean Squared Error
		3. Root mean squared Error
	        4. R-square 
	        The required dataset is attached as https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/online-retail-ecommerce-dataset
