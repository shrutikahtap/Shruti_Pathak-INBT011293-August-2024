Repository created for iNeubytes Data Science project submission which consistes of :

Task 1: Analysis and processing of data, and with it's help predicting if the patient is diabetic(1) or not(0). Task 1 incorporates the various classifcation methods to predict
        whether the patient suffers from diabeties or not. The methods to classify includes :
		    1. Decision Tree Classifier
	        2. Random Forest Classifier
		    3. Naive Bayes Classifier
	        4. K Nearest Neighbour Classifier
		 And I also deployed confusion matrix as a part of evaluation methods to check :
            1. Accuracy
			2. Recall
            3. Precision
			4. F1 Score
